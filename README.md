# HAWP_road_predictions
Follow all instructions in the original HAWP github readme before executing any of this

There are two seperate folders and each are used to generate the train/val/test.jsons used in the HAWP framework.

For each of the folders copy the files into the directory respective to the root directory of the HAWP repo that you have cloned

For example, if it is in CULane/* place it in hawp/* in the root directory, if it is in Llamas/scripts/* place it in hawp/scripts/* for training on the llamas dataset

There are also shell scripts included which are specifically to be executed on the computecanada graham clusters.

Further more detailed instructions are found in each individual folder
